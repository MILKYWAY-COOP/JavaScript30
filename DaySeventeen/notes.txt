Sorting an  Array
The sort() method sorts an array alphabetically. The default
sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements
into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 units
values.

The trim()
This method removes whitespace from both ends of a string and 
returns a new string, without modifying the original string.

join()
This method creates and returns a new string by concatenating 
all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object), 
separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the
array has only one item, then that item will be returned without
using the separator.
