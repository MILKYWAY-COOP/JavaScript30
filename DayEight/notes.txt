HTML Canvas Graphics
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, 
via JavaScript. The canvas element is only a container for graphics.
JavaScript must be used to actually draw the graphics.

innerWidth -> returns the interior width of the window in pixels.
.strokeStyle -> sets/returns the color, gradient or pattern
used for strokes.
.lineJoin -> Sets/returns the type of corner created, when two
lines meet.
.linecap -> Determines the shape used to draw the end points
of lines.
.beginPath() -> called before beginning each line, so that they
may be drawn with different colors.
.moveto() -> moves the path to the specified point in the 
canvas, without creating a line.
.lineTo() adds a new point and creates a line TO that point
FROM the last specified point in the canvas (this method
does not draw the line).
