The some() method tests whether at least one element in 
the array passes the test implemented by the provided
function. It returns true if, in the array, it finds an 
element for which the provided function returns true;
otherrwise it returns false.

The every() method tests whether all elements in the array
pass the test implemented by the provided function. It 
returns a Boolean value.

The find() method returns the first element in the provided
array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no
values satify the testing function, undefined is returned.

Spread syntax (...)
The spread operator allows an iterable such as an array expression
or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments
(for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, 
or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or 
more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.
