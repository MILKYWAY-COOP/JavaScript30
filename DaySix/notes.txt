then() -> method returns a Promise. It atkes up two arguments:
callback functions for the success and failure cases of the
Promise.

Promise
The promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure)
of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. A promise
is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise
is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an 
asynchronous action's eventual success or failure reason.

RegExp object
A regular expression is a pattern of characters. The pattern is 
used to do pattern-matching "search-and-replace" functions on text.
In JavaScript, a RegExp Object is a pattern with Properties and
Methods.
Regular expressions.
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search
pattern. When you search for data in text, you can use this search
pattern to describe what you are searching for.
Example:
/stephen/i;
/stephen/i is a regular expression.
stephen is a pattern (to be used in a search).
i is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive).

/regexp/ is an ECMAScript feature.
g => Perform a global match(find all matches rather than stopping
after the first match)
i => Perform case-insensitive matching.
m => Perform multiline matching.
