then() -> method returns a Promise. It atkes up two arguments:
callback functions for the success and failure cases of the
Promise.

Promise
The promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure)
of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. A promise
is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise
is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an 
asynchronous action's eventual success or failure reason.
