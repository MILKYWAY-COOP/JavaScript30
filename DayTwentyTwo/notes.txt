Element.classList
The Element.classList is a read-only property that returns a live'
DOMTokenList collection of the class attribute of the element. This
can then be used to manipulate the class list.

Value
A DOMTokenList representing the contents of the element's class 
attribute. If the class attribute is not set or empty, it returns 
an empty DOMTokenList, i.e. a DOMTokenList with the length property 
equal to 0.

Although the classList property itself is read-only, you can modify 
its associated DOMTokenList using the add(), remove(), replace(), 
and toggle() methods.
